    1/6 INTRODUCTION:
        This module introduces deployment patterns and explains microservices architecture to help 
            improve the deployment cycle and examine classical and modern deployment patterns.
        ! Continuous Delivery is an extension of Continuous Integration. 
        It's all about getting changes to customers quickly and using sustainable methods. !
    2/6 Explore microservices architecture:
        Today, you'll frequently hear the term microservices. A microservice is an autonomous, independently deployable, and scalable software component.
        ! Each microservice has its lifecycle and Continuous Delivery pipeline. 
        If you built them correctly, you could deploy new microservice versions without impacting other system parts. !
    3/6 Examine classical deployment patterns:
        When we have our prerequisites to deliver our software continuously, 
            we need to start thinking about a deployment pattern.
    4/6 Understand modern deployment patterns:
        ! To overcome, we need to embrace that some features can only be tested in production. !
        When we take this concept of feature toggling and use it with our deployment patterns, 
            we can test our software in production.

    1/8 INTRODUCTION:
        This module describes the blue-green deployment process and introduces feature toggle techniques to implement in the development process.
    2/8 What is blue-green deployment?:
        Blue-green deployment is a technique that reduces risk and downtime by running two identical environments. 
            These environments are called blue and green.
    3/8 Explore deployment slots:
        When using a cloud platform like Azure, doing blue-green deployments is relatively easy.
        ! You can use an out-of-the-box feature called deployment slots when using web apps. !
        You can use a deployment slot to set up a new version of your application, and when ready, swap the production environment with the new staging environment.
            It's done by an internal swapping of the IP addresses of both slots.
    4/8 Exercise - set up a blueâ€“green deployment:
        Let's now look at how a release pipeline can be used to implement blue-green deployments.
        Initially create App in Azure Portal.
    5/8 Introduction to feature toggles:
        Feature Flags allow you to change how our system works without making significant changes to the code.
        Feature Flags are sometimes called Feature Toggles instead.
        ! By exposing new features by just "flipping a switch" at runtime, 
            we can deploy new software without exposing any new or changed functionality to the end-user. !
        The business owner plays a vital role in the process, and you need to work closely with them to choose the right strategy.
        What are feature toggles?:
            Feature toggles are also known as feature flippers, feature flags, feature switches, conditional features, and so on.
            ! Besides the power they give you on the business side, they also provide an advantage on the development side. !
        How to implement a feature toggle:
            In the purest form, a feature toggle is an IF statement.
    6/8 Describe feature toggle maintenance:
        A feature toggle is just code. 
        And to be more specific, conditional code. 
        It adds complexity to the code and increases the technical debt.

    1/6 INTRODUCTION:
        This module describes deployment strategies around canary releases and dark launching and examines traffic managers.
    2/6 Explore canary releases:
        The term canary release comes from the days that miners took a canary with them into the coal mines.
        A canary release is a way to identify potential problems without exposing all your end users to the issue at once.
        ! The idea is that you tell a new feature only to a minimal subset of users. !
    3/6 Examine Traffic Manager:
        ! To control traffic in Azure, you can use a component called Azure Traffic Manager. !
        Azure Traffic Manager:
            Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables you to distribute traffic optimally 
                to services across global Azure regions while providing high availability and responsiveness.
        Controlling your canary release:
            Using a combination of feature toggles, deployment slots, and Traffic Manager, 
                you can achieve complete control over the traffic flow and enable your canary release.
    4/6 Understand dark launching:
        ! Dark launching is in many ways like canary releases. !
        ! However, the difference here's that you're looking to assess users' responses to new features in your frontend 
            rather than testing the performance of the backend. !
        How to implement dark launching:
            In essence, dark launching doesn't differ from a canary release or the implementation and switching of a feature toggle.
            The feature is released and only exposed at a particular time.
