STEP 4.1:
    1/8 INTRODUCTION:
        This module introduces continuous delivery concepts and their implementation in a traditional IT development cycle.
    2/8 Explore traditional IT development cycle:
        Silo-based development:
            Long release cycles, numerous tests, code freezes, night and weekend work, and many people ensure that everything works.
    3/8 What is continuous delivery?:
        Continuous delivery (CD) is a set of processes, tools, and techniques for rapid, reliable, and continuous software development and delivery.
    4/8 Move to continuous delivery:
        But creating working software isn't the same as delivering working software.
    5/8 Understand releases and deployments:
        One of the essential steps in moving software more quickly to production is changing how we deliver software to production.
        What is a release, and what is a deployment?:
            When we talk about releases and deployments, we see that commonly used tools deal differently with the terminology as we did in the previous chapter.
            ! A release is a package or container containing a versioned set of artifacts specified in a release pipeline in your CI/CD process. !
            Deployment is the action of running the tasks for one stage, which results in a tested and deployed application and other activities specified for that stage.
        Separating technical releases from functional releases:
    6/8 Understand release process versus release:
        We start with defining a release process or release pipeline.
        The release pipeline contains all the steps you walk through when you move your artifact from one of the artifact sources discussed earlier through the stages or environments.
        The release itself is something different. The release is an instance of the release pipeline. You can compare it with object instantiation.
